# Microsoft AI x Canada - Industry Project

## Project Overview

This project was a collaborative initiative between BrainStation and Microsoft, aimed at addressing the challenges faced by Microsoft's Canadian customers in adapting to AI innovations while enhancing public trust and increasing the adoption of generative AI technologies.

## Problem Statement

In 2022, Canada's health-care system faced unprecedented wait times, with a median of 27.4 weeks, the longest ever recorded. Additionally, the accuracy of information from search engines and the lack of certified professionals further exacerbated the issue. Moreover, transparency in medical record-keeping was a challenge, with fees being charged for labor time and mailing, making it difficult for patients to access their own health information.

## Solution: OneHealth

To tackle these issues, we developed **OneHealth** , an AI-integrated client platform designed specifically for Canadians. The platform includes:

- **Symptom Tracker** : Enhances appointment outcomes by assisting with accurate symptom recall.
- **Medical Record Management** : Utilizes a pre-trained model tailored for medical terminology to improve record transparency and reduce costs.
- **AI Q&A** : Provides real-time answers to patient inquiries, alleviating the workload on healthcare professionals.
- **AI-Enhanced Chat** : Streamlines communication, avoiding spam, and ensuring that important messages are delivered.

## Microsoft Mission

Our project aligns with Microsoft's mission to "empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more." Through **OneHealth** , we strive to empower patients and healthcare providers in Canada by leveraging AI to improve healthcare delivery, transparency, and communication.
